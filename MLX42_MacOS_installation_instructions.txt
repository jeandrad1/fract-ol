First you have to copy the MLX42 folder in sgoinfre and execute:

rm -rf $HOME/.brew && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Homebrew/brew $HOME/.brew && echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.brew/bin:$PATH' >> $HOME/.zshrc && source $HOME/.zshrc && brew update

Second you have to close the terminal and open it again to execute:

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docgloucester/42homebrew_sgoinfre/master/install.sh | zsh

Then you must close and open the terminal again and execute:

brew install glfw

Now the MLX42 library is installed and you just have to do a "make" in the MLX42 folder. 

You can use the testing main.c in MLX42 to check if it works.

gcc main.c ./MLX42/libmlx42.a -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL -framework IOKit -Iinclude -lglfw -L"/Users/jeandrad/.brew/opt/glfw/lib/"
